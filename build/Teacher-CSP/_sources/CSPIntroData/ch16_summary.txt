Chapter 16 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 16 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: append
    single: for each loop
    single: list
    single: len
    single: index
    single: out of range error
    single: range
    single: string
    
- **Append** - To append means to combine two strings with the characters from the second string following right after the characters in the first string.  In Python you can use the ``+`` operator to append strings.  This is also called **concatenation**.  
- **For Each Loop** - A for each loop loops executes the body of the loop one time for each element in a collection (a string or list).  
- **List** - A list holds items in order.  An example of a list is ``[1, 2, 3]``.   
- **Len** - The ``len`` function returns the number of items in a collection (a string or a list).  
- **Index** - The index is the position of the item in a list or string.  In Python the first item is at index 0.  
- **Out of Range Error** - An out of range error will occur if you try to access an item in a list and give it an invalid index.  The first item in a list is at index 0 and the last is at one less than the length.
- **Range** - The ``range`` function returns a list of numbers.  For example, ``range(3)`` returns the list ``[0, 1, 2]``.  
- **String** - A string is a collection of characters in order.  In python the characters are inside a pair of single or double quotes.
