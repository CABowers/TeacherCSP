Chapter 4 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 4 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: append
	single: concatenate
	single: immutable
	single: object
	single: string

- **Append** - You can add two strings together using the ``+`` symbol.  This is also called **concatenate**.  
- **Concatenate** - You can use ``+`` to concatenate (append) two strings like this ``string3 = string1 + string2``.  This will create a new string called ``string3`` with all the characters from the first string, ``string1``, followed by all the characters in the second string, ``string2``.
- **Immutable** - Immutable means that it does not change.  Strings are immutable in Python.  When you do something that appears to change a string, it will actually return a new string.  
- **Object** - Strings and turtles are objects in Python.  An object can have behavior (things it can do).  For example a turtle object can go forward a specified amount. 
- **String** - A string is a sequence of characters.  You specify a string as characters inside a pair of single or double quotes.
