Chapter 13 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 13 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: and
    single: boolean expression
    single: condition
    single: conditional execution
    single: decision
    single: elif
    single: if
    single: input
    single: logical expression
    single: str 


- **And** - The keyword ``and`` is used to join two **logical expressions** and then both of the **logical expressions** must be true for the joined expression to be true.
- **Boolean Expression** - A Boolean expression is one that is either true or false.  This is also called a **logical expression**.  
- **Condition** - A condition is something that is either true or false.  This is also called a **Boolean expression** or a **logical expression**.  
- **Conditional Execution** - Conditional execution means that one or more statements are executed only when a condition (**logical expression**) is true.  This is also called a **conditional**.  The statements that are executed when the condition is true are called the **body**.  
- **Decision** - A decision is a choice between at least two choices.  
- **Elif** - The keyword ``elif`` is used when you want to have a conditional with 3 or more possibile options.  Add as many ``elif`` statements as you need after an ``if`` and before a ``else``.  
- **If** - The keyword ``if`` is used to begin a conditional statement.  
- **Input** - The ``input`` function returns a value that the user enters.  
- **Logical Expression** - A logical expression is one that is either true or false, like ``x == 3``.  This is also called a **Boolean expression**.  
- **Str** - The function ``str`` turns a number into a string so that it can be appended to a string.
