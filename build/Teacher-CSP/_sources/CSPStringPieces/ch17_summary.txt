Chapter 17 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 17 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: list
    single: index
    single: parameter
    single: split

- **List** - A list holds items in order.  An example of a list is ``[1, 2, 3]``.   
- **Index** - The index is the position of the item in a list or string.  In Python the first item is at index 0.  
- **Parameter** - A parameter is input to a procedure or function that is specified when you define the procedure or function.  This is also called a **formal parameter**. The parameter will be assigned a value when the procedure or function is called.
- **Split** - The ``split`` function returns a list of strings separated by a specified character.  For example, if ``message = "Nora, Jones, 15"`` then ``message.split(",")`` would return ``['Nora', 'Jones', '15']``.
