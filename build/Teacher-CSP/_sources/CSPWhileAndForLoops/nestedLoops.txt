Nested For Loops
=================

The body of any loop, can even include...another loop!  Here is a super-simple program that generates all the times tables from 0 to 10.  The ``str()`` function changes a numeric value into a string.

.. codelens:: Times_Table
	:showoutput: 

	for x in range(0,11):
	    for y in range(0,11):
	        print(str(x) + " * " + str(y) + " = " + str(x*y))
		

Here are two different ways to look at this program.  In the first one, we look at the *structure* of the program -- what you can understand by just *looking* at the program.

In this video, we look at the *execution* of the program -- how it actually works when it's being *run* by the computer.
