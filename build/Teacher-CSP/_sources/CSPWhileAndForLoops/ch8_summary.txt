Chapter 8 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 8 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
	single: body of a loop
	single: counter
	single: definite loop
	single: for loop
	single: increment
	single: infinite loop
	single: logical expression
	single: while loop
	
- **Body of a Loop** - The body of a loop is a statement or set of statements to be repeated in a loop.  The body of a loop is indicated in Python with indention.  
- **Counter** - A counter is a variable that is used to count something in a program.  
- **Definite Loop** - A definite loop repeats a specific number of times.  A ``for`` loop is a definite loop.  
- **For Loop** - A ``for`` loop is a programming statement that tells the computer to repeat a statement or a set of statements. It is used to repeat a loop a specific number of times.
- **Increment** - Increment means to increase the value of a variable by 1. 
- **Infinite Loop** - An infinite loop is one that never ends.  
- **Logical Expression** - An logical expression is either true or false.  An example of a logical expression is ``x < 3``.  
- **While Loop** - A ``while`` loop is a programming statement that tells the computer to repeat a statement or a set of statements. It repeats the **body of the loop** while a **logical expression** is true.
