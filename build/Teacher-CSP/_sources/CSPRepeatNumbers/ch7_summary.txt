Chapter 7 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 7 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: accumulator pattern
	single: body of a loop
	single: for loop
	single: indention
	single: iteration
	single: list
	single: loop
	single: print
	single: range
	
- **Accumulator Pattern** - The accumulator pattern is a set of steps that processes a list of values.  One example of an accumulator pattern is the code to sum a list of numbers.  
- **Body of a Loop** - The body of a loop is a statement or set of statements to be repeated in a loop.  Python uses indention to indicate the body of a loop.  
- **For Loop** - A ``for`` loop is a programming statement that tells the computer to repeat a statement or a set of statements. It is one type of loop. 
- **Indention** - Indention means that the text on the line has spaces at the beginning of the line so that the text doesn't start right at the left boundary of the line.  In Python indention is used to specify which statements are in the same block.  For example the body of a loop is indented 4 more spaces than the statement starting the loop.   
- **Iteration** - Iteration is the ability to repeat a step or set of steps in a computer program.   This is also called **looping**.  
- **List** - A list holds a sequence of items in order.  An example of a list in Python is ``[1, 2, 3]``.
- **Loop** - A loop tells the computer to repeat a statement or set of statements. 
- **Print** - The ``print`` statement in Python will print the value of the items passed to it.  
- **Range** - The ``range`` function in Python returns a list of consecutive values.  It can take one or two values.  If given one value it returns a list with the numbers from 0 up to and not including the passed number.  If given two numbers it returns a list including the first number and then up to but not including the second number.  For example, ``range(1,4)`` returns the list ``[1, 2, 3]``.
