Chapter 12 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 12 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: and
    single: block of code
    single: boolean expression
    single: complex conditionals
    single: condition
    single: conditional execution
    single: decision
    single: else
    single: flowchart
    single: if
	single: logical expression
	single: not

- **And** - The keyword ``and`` is used to join two logical expressions and then both of the logical expressions must be true for the joined expression to be true.
- **Block of Code** - A block of code in Python is one or more code statements that are part of a loop, conditional, function, or procedure.
- **Boolean Expression** - A Boolean expression is one that is either true or false.  This is also called a **logical expression**.  
- **Complex Conditionals** - A complex conditional has two or more logical expressions joined by the keywords ``and``, ``or``, or ``not``.  
- **Condition** - A condition is something that is either true or false.  This is also called a **Boolean expression** or a **logical expression**.  
- **Conditional Execution** - Conditional execution means that one or more statements are executed only when a condition (**logical expression**) is true.  This is also called a **conditional**.  The statements that are executed when the condition is true are called the **body of the loop**.  
- **Decision** - A decision is a choice between at least two choices.  
- **Else** - The keyword ``else`` is used to execute one or more statements in a block following the ``else`` when the condition in the ``if`` part of the statement is false.  An ``else`` must always have an ``if`` statement before it.
- **Flowchart** - A flowchart is a diagram that shows the execution paths for a program.  The conditionals are shown as diamonds.  
- **If** - The Python keyword ``if`` is used to start a condition. It is followed by a Boolean expression and then has one or more statements in the body of the loop that are executed only if the Boolean expression is true. 
- **Logical Expression** - A logical expression is one that is either true or false, like ``x == 3`` which will return true if x is equal to 3.  This is also called a **Boolean expression**.  
- **Not** - The keyword ``not`` is used to negate a **logical expression**.  If the original expression is true the negated expression is false and if the original expression is false the negated expression is true.
