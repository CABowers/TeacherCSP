	single: stamp
	single: total turtle trip theorem
	single: turtle geometry

- **For Loop** - A ``for`` loop is a programming statement that tells the computer to repeat a statement or a set of statements which are called the **body** of the loop or the **loop body**. It will repeat a specific number of times.
- **Loop Body** - The statement or statements that are repeated in a loop.  In Python indention is used to show the statements that are part of the body of a loop.
- **Range** - The ``range`` function in Python returns a list of values.  It can take one or two values.  If given one value it returns a list with the numbers from 0 up to and not including the passed number.  If given two numbers it returns a list including the first number and then up to, but not including the second number.  For example, ``range(1,4)`` returns the list ``[1, 2, 3]``.
- **Stamp** - The ``stamp`` procedure leaves a copy of the turtle's shape at its current location.  
- **Total Turtle Trip Theorem** - The total turtle trip theorem states that the turtle will draw a closed figure with n sides when the sum of the angles turned is a multiple of 360. 
- **Turtle Geometry** - Turtle Geometry is a book by Hal Abelson and Andrea diSessa that explores math using turtles.
