- **Function** - A function is a named set of instructions that *returns a result*.  An example is the ``abs(num)`` which returns the absolute value of the num.  
- **Library** - A library is a named group of related procedures and functions.  An example is the Turtle library.
- **Modulo** - The modulo, or remainder operator, ``%``, returns the remainder after you divide one value by another.  For example the remainder of ``3 % 2`` is 1 since 2 goes into 3 one time with a remainder of 1.  
- **Procedure** - A procedure is a named set of instructions that *does not return a result*, but can cause something to happen like the turtle ``forward(amount)`` procedure.  
- **Random** - The ``randrange`` function is used to return a random number.  It is part of the ``random`` library.
