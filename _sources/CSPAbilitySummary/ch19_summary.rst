Chapter 19 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 19 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: abstraction
    single: conditional
    single: Halting Problem
    single: Turing Machine

- **Abstraction** - Abstraction is used to remove unnecessary details.  For example, after you create a procedure or function and test it, you can call it without having to think about how it works.  
- **Conditional** - A conditional allows for code to be executed when a condition is true.  
- **Halting Problem** - Alan Turing proved that it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt.
- **Turing Machine** - A Turing machine is a theoretical computer that can read instructions from a tape and write results to the tape.
