Chapter 4 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 4 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: append
    single: capitalize
	single: concatenate
	single: find
	single: function
	single: immutable
	single: index
	single: len
	single: lower
	single: object
	single: string

- **Append** - You can add two strings together using the ``+`` symbol.  This is also called **concatenate**.  
- **Capitalize** - The capitalize function returns a new string with the first character capitalized.
- **Concatenate** - You can use ``+`` to concatenate (append) two strings like this ``string3 = string1 + string2``.  This will create a new string called ``string3`` with all the characters from the first string, ``string1``, followed by all the characters in the second string, ``string2``.
- **Find** - The find function takes a string as input and returns the **index** of the first occurence of that string in the string the function is called on.  
- **Function** - A function returns a value.  Function can take input as well, but don't have to.  An example is the string ``lower()`` function that returns a string with all lowercase letters.
- **Immutable** - Immutable means that it does not change.  Strings are immutable in Python.  When you do something that appears to change a string, it will actually return a new string.  
- **Index** - An index is a number associated with the position of a character in a string.  In Python the first character in a string is at index 0.  
- **Len** - The len function that can take a string as input and returns the number of characters in the string including any spaces.
- **Lower** - The lower string function returns a new string with only lowercase letters.
- **Object** - An object can have behavior (things it can do).  For example a turtle object can go forward a specified amount. Strings and turtles are objects in Python.  
- **String** - A string is a sequence of characters.  You specify a string as characters inside a pair of single or double quotes.
