Chapter 5 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 5 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: body syntonic
    single: comment
	single: object
	single: string

- **Body Syntonic** - Body syntonic means experiences related to knowledge of your body.  You can use your knowledge of how to move your body to help you understand how to move the turtle objects.  
- **Comment** - A comment describes one or more lines of code.  Comments are ignored by the computer.  A comment in Python starts with ``#``.  The computer will ignore everything from the start of the comment to the end of that line. 
- **Object** - Turtles are objects in Python.  Objects can have data and behavior.  A turtle object knows its heading (data) and can go forward and turn (behavior).
- **String** - A string is a sequence of characters.  You specify a string as characters inside a pair of single or double quotes.
