Chapter 9 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 9 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: accumulator pattern
    single: for loop
    single: palindrome
    single: range
	single: string

- **Accumulator Pattern** - The accumulator pattern is a set of steps that processes a list of values.  One example of an accumulator pattern is the code to sum a list of numbers.  
- **For Loop** - A ``for`` loop is a programming statement that tells the computer to repeat a statement or a set of statements. It is used to repeat a loop a specific number of times.
- **Palindrome** - A palindrome has the same letters if you read it from left to right as it does if you read it from right to left.  An example is ``"A but tuba"``.  
- **Print** - The ``print`` statement in Python will print the value of the items passed to it.  
- **Range** - The ``range`` function in Python returns a list of consecutive values.  It can take one or two values.  If given one value it returns a list with the numbers from 0 up to and not including the passed number.  If given two numbers it returns a list including the first number and then up to but not including the second number.  For example, ``range(1,4)`` returns the list ``[1, 2, 3]``.
- **String** - A string is a collection of letters, numbers, and other characters like spaces inside of a pair of single or double quotes.
