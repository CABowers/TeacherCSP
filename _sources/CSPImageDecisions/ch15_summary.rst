Chapter 15 - Concept Summary
============================

Chapter 15 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: condition
    single: conditional execution
    single: decision
    single: edge detection
    single: elif
    single: else
    single: if
    single: posterize

- **Condition** - A condition is something that is either true or false.  This is also called a **Boolean expression** or a **logical expression**.  
- **Conditional Execution** - Conditional execution means that one or more statements are executed only when a condition (**logical expression**) is true.  This is also called a **conditional**.  The statements that are executed when the condition is true are called the **body of the loop**.  
- **Decision** - A decision is a choice between at least two choices. 
- **Edge Detection** - Edge detection is a image processing technique.  It finds the "edges" in an image which are the areas of high constrast or where the color changes.   
- **Elif** - The keyword ``elif`` is used when you want to have a conditional with 3 or more possibile options.  Add as many ``elif`` statements as you need after an ``if`` and before a ``else``.  
- **Else** - The keyword ``else`` is used to execute one or more statements in a block following the ``else`` when the condition in the ``if`` part of the statement is false. An ``else`` must always have an ``if`` statement before it.
- **If** - The keyword ``if`` is used to begin a conditional statement. It is followed by a **Boolean expression** and one or more statements that are executed only if the **Boolean expression** is true. 
- **Posterize** - Posterize means to reduce the number of colors in an image so that it looks like a poster.
